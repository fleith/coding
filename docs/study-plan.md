# Study Plan

## Weekly Loop
1. Pick one topic (algorithm or data structure).
2. Implement from scratch without references.
3. Add tests for normal, edge, and empty inputs.
4. Write complexity notes.
5. Solve 2-3 related interview problems.

## Suggested Order
1. Sorting basics: bubble, selection, insertion
2. Divide and conquer: merge, quick
3. Heap and heap sort
4. Hash map and set problems
5. Linked list patterns
6. Tree and graph traversal

## Done Criteria For A Topic
- Implementation is correct.
- Tests cover edge cases.
- You can explain complexity and tradeoffs from memory.
